# Prompt Tracker

## Version: 2.0 - Real Strands Agents Integration
**Focus:** Production-ready prompt engineering for Strands Agents with AWS Core MCP Server integration
**Outcome:** Implemented sophisticated system prompts that leverage real AWS service data through MCP tools for accurate, current architecture generation
**Learnings:** Real-time AWS data integration significantly improves output quality and accuracy compared to static templates
**Next Focus:** Optimize prompts for specific AWS service combinations and implement advanced prompt chaining strategies

## Version: 1.0
**Focus:** Dynamic prompt construction for AWS Solution Architect role-based template generation
**Outcome:** Implemented role-aware prompt generation that adapts based on selected AWS Solution Architect roles and enabled MCP servers
**Learnings:** Role-based prompting provides more targeted and relevant architecture generation compared to generic prompts
**Next Focus:** Enhance prompts with specific AWS service recommendations and best practices for each role combination

## Prompt Strategy
- **Real AWS Integration:** System prompts designed to leverage MCP tools for current AWS service information
- **Role-Based Context:** Include selected roles in prompt to provide relevant architectural guidance
- **MCP Server Awareness:** Reference enabled MCP servers to leverage specialized knowledge
