# ⚙️ Structure
/frontend → React + Tailwind (TypeScript, minimal deps)  
/backend → FastAPI (Python 3.11+, async, stateless)  
/docs → product & prompt trackers  
/prompts → evolving prompt strategies  
/tests → small automation tests  
Each folder has a short `README.md` (1 paragraph).

---

# 🧩 Implementation
- **No unnecessary files, mocks, or placeholders.**
- Prefer modifying existing modules over creating new ones.
- Functions/classes <100 lines; modules <500 lines.
- Use `.env` or AWS Secrets Manager for credentials.
- **Never commit `.env` files or hardcoded credentials — use `.gitignore` and `env.example` templates.**
- Avoid redundant dependencies and UI libraries.
- Code must read like documentation — clean, async, minimal.
- **Never create new documentation files — always use existing trackers (`/docs/product_tracker.md`, `/prompts/prompt_tracker.md`) and follow their established formats.**

---

# 🚀 Build & Install
- If install fails (missing deps or flags), update `requirements.txt` / `package.json` and `/docs/product_tracker.md`.
- Maintain lightweight setup scripts:
  - `/backend/setup.sh`
  - `/frontend/setup.sh`
- Confirm each dependency is essential before committing.

Next Focus:  

- Each entry ≤7 lines.
- Summarize older entries; archive after 3 releases (`/docs/archive/`).
- Keep total tracker size <200 lines.

---

# 📦 Releases
- Each stable iteration → new version in `/releases/vX.Y/`.
  - Include `rules.yaml`, `product_summary.md`, `prompt_summary.md`, `changelog.md`.
- Update `/releases/release_log.md` with one-line summaries.
- Summaries auto-generated from trackers; <150 words.
- Snapshot `.cursor/rules` for version reproducibility.

---

# 🔄 Collaboration & Evolution (project-specific)
- Review trackers weekly; prune clutter.
- Summarize plans before major code generation.
- Use releases and snapshotting to maintain reproducible versions.

---

# 🧠 Goal
A **lean, evolving, self-documenting** project.
Fast to understand, easy to maintain, and pleasant to extend.
No excess. No fluff. Built for longevity.
